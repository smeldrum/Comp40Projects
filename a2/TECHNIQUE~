Assignment 2: Part E
A Technique We Hope to Develop
As Comp 40 students who are becoming more fluent in programming and its 
concepts, sometimes we feel as if one of our main hindrances is the
environment in which we are working with the code.  Although we find
that the Kate Editor is aesthetically pleasing and allows us to
compile within the interface, many past Comp 40 students (and current
TA's) recommend VIM as a next step in our development as computer
programmers.
Because of this, we have researched some of the components that make
VIM so invaluable to computer programmers.  Some benefits include:
- The rich library of macros available to use at our disposal.  Although
it might take a bit to learn, it can make certain aspects of coding (copy
/pasting lines of code, duplicating lines, automated search and replace, 
etc.) so much more streamlined, and thus makes the burden of actually putting
 down on the text editor diminish quite a bit.
